What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 When we initialize a repository, a git repository is created and a .git file is also created.
 Usually the .git file is hidden but we can find it if use "ls -a" command.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 The working directory is the repository in which the original files are stored.But the staging is a intermediate
 stage between the working directory and the commit. Before making a commit the files are added to staging area 
 using "git add file_name" command. The status of directory can be checked using "git status" command.
